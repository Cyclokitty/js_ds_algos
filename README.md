Companion repo to a course on Udemy.com

## Part of my '#30DaysOfAlgosAndDataStructures' on Twitter
Keeping track of my progress and resources I use learning data structures and practicing algos.

## Recursion Tips:

1. Figure out the bare minimum pieces of information to represent your problem.
2. Give reasonable defaults to the bare minimum pieces of info.
3. Check the base case. Is there any work left to do? If not, return.
4. Do some work. Call your function again, making sure the arguments have changed in some fashion.
